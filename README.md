A **Discord Bot** that detects hidden traps in Clash of Clans villages from a screenshot.  

> ⚠️ This bot is meant as an **extra help** for players.  
> It is designed to assist when you can’t figure out where traps are, **not** to replace your own strategy and gameplay.

## 🚀 How it Works  
The bot uses **machine learning (AI)** models trained on a private dataset.  
Just follow these steps:  

1. Attach a screenshot of the base you want to analyze.  
2. Run the bot’s `/locate` command.  
3. The bot will predict and mark the hidden traps on the image.

## 📖 Usage Policy  
- The project is **open source**.  
- You can use the bot for **free** hosting it by yourself.
