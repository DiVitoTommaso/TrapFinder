# Clash Of Clans – Trap Finder  

A **Discord Bot** that detects hidden traps in Clash of Clans villages from a screenshot.  

---

## 🚀 How it Works  
The bot uses **machine learning (AI)** models trained on a private dataset.  
Just follow these steps:  

1. Attach a screenshot of the base you want to analyze.  
2. Run the bot’s `/locate` command.  
3. The bot will predict and mark the hidden traps on the image.
